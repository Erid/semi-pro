# Edge cases for the application

* A team getting/being dropped by an org mid-tournament
* 1v1 games instead of team vs team, most likely still used as "team", but display should be different for 1 player team?
* Roster changes off-tournament and mid-tournament (not common)
  * Not allowing players to be deleted, only inactive can solve this easily
* Banned players
* Disqualified teams
* No-show games
* Leagues with seasons and multiple tiers for a signle season? (think RSC with many tiers)
  * Usually a tournament could be a season, which might be fine, just have multiple tournaments with the word "Season N" in them
