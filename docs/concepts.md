# Core concepts of Semi-Pro

## (E)sports

Rocket League, Smash, CS, Ping Pong, etc

## Leagues

* This are to contain multiple tournaments

Note: Should we handle seasons as a concept?, I think we might be better without it as a concept

## Tournaments

* Tournaments can be stand-alone or as part of a league
* A Challonge link could be added for more info
* Teams can be added to the tournament
* Series can be added to the tournament

## Series

* Series define a match between two teams.
* They are part of a tournament
* Can have a format of Best of N or just N Games
* Depending on the format they can be won, loss or tied

## Games

* They are part of a Series
* Teams AND players are associated to games
* Games should store stats and links based on the (e)sport

## Organizations

* They have an owner
* They can have multiple teams on multiple (e)sports

### Rosters

* Main team members of (e)sport
* When creating a team, selecting an org could fill the team based off the roster

Note: This amy not be necessary and they can be inferred from their latest team on a tournament.

## People

* Profile picture and other pictures
* Per (e)sport they can include things like settings, bindings and equipment
* Social media links

## Team Members

* They are Person that are part of a team
* They can have different roles (player, captain, coach, manager)
* They can be active or inactive
* One Person can be more than once as player as long as they have different roles (i.e. A player that's a captain too, or a coach that's a manager)

### Captain

* Usually the first contact for the team, unless there's a manager

### Coach

* They could eventually have some tools for them, tho Ballchasing already has an amazing tool

### Player

* Can be selected as part of games to get stats

### Substitute

* Just like a player, but with a different connotation

### Manager

* Eventually this role could provide some functionality

## Users
